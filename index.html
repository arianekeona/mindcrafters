                <h2>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h2>
                <hr class="dashleft">
                <p>Once we decided on our main features for the app, our team member, Ariane, sketched out some low-fidelity wireframes of the app solution.
                    Depicted here are sketches for the home page, quest page, and profile page. The sketches were based on our group's finalized set of features:
                    calm quests, badges, and a matching feature.
                </p>

                <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
                <hr class="dashright">
                <p>From then on, Ariane transferred the low-fidelity sketches into mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma. The mid-fidelity wireframes that were designed
                    were for the primary pages of the application: the home page with both a weekly and daily view, a specific quest page, a page to complete a quiz that
                    matches the user to mental health resources, and the profile page. We conducted some usability testing on these wireframes to gain insight on how best
                    to implement those ideas into our high-fidelity designs.

                <h2>High-Fidelity Mockups</h2>
                <hr class="dashleft">
                <p>After consolidating our ideas from the mid and lo-fi wireframes, our group moved on to designing the high-fidelity mockups of CalmConnect. We first 
                    decided on a typeface and color palette that was both engaging and relaxing to the eyes. With regards to the mockups themselves, they consist of our 
                    finalized features: offering daily calm quests with progress trackers and guided tips, earning badges for completing the calm quests, and supplying 
                    mental health resources based on quiz responses from users.
